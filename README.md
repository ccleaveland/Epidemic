# Epidemic
Discover a cure and eradicate the disease before everyone is infected!

## Game Summary
A game board is randomly created with one hospital tile, one laboratory tile, and a remaining mixture of forest and town tiles.  At the start of the game, the player will begin on the hospital tile and one random town tile will be infected.  

The player must move around the board and search forest and town tiles for three items necessary to develop a cure.  Collected items may be viewed in the player’s inventory.

Every time the player moves to a different tile there is a chance that another random town tile will become infected. If all town tiles on the board become infected, the player loses.  Players have a starting health of 5 and will lose 1 health whenever they move to an infected tile.  If the player’s health goes to 0, the player loses.  Health can be replenished by healing at the hospital.

Once all items have been found, the player can perform research at the laboratory to receive a cure.  No new infections of town tiles will occur after the cure has been discovered.  The player must travel to each infected town tile to deliver the cure and remove the infection. When all infected tiles have been treated, the player wins.
